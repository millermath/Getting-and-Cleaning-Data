##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

###Introduction
This repository contains the files for the course project in the John Hopkins Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The data for the project as well as a description of the data can be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The goal of the project is to take the numerous files that one extracts from the original source and product a cleaned up version of the data set. 

###Files
This repository contains the following additional files:

1) Codebook.md: The Codebook describes the variables,
2) run_analysis.r: This is the script that produces the final clean data set TidyData.txt
3) TidyData.txt: This is the actual text file produced by run_analysis.r

###Explanation of Data Cleaning Process:
run_analysis.r does the following:

(1) Downloads the zipped dataset and creates a directory "Getting and Cleaning Data" if there is no such directory.It then unzips the file. 

(2) Reads in all the separate files from the UCI HAR dataset into memory.

(3) Adds variable names for all the columns for the datasets in (2) based on the information available in the readme and codebook that come with the original dataset.

(4) Merges the various datasets together into one dataset

(5) Extracts only those measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. In this case, certain variables (e.g. frequencyBodyAccJerkMag_Meanfrequency or angle(X,gravityMean) ) were questionable whether these fit the spirit of the analysis. I made the decision to include them, since present information can always removed easily but absent information is more difficult to obtain. 

(6) The variable names were then cleaned up so as to be both more descriptive as well as something that R could recognize. 

(7) Averages were taken of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result was now 180 rows since there were 30 subjects, each of whom performed the 6 possible activity types. 

(8) Activity Types were then added to the data set by merging by activityID. Thus one can see the activity types in the data directly rather than just the code. 

(9) Columns were reordered so the subjectID, activityID, and activityType were present at the beginning of the dataset followed by the various measured quantities. 

(10) The rows were then ordered by subjectID and then by activityID. 

(11) Finally the clean data set is produced as a txt file.
